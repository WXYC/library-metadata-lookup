A single warm task can fan out to many Discogs API calls (one per
unresolved `[a…]`/`[r…]`/`[m…]` ref the local cache misses). The semaphore
bounds the total in-flight API load when several flowsheet entries get
committed in quick succession. 4 is conservative — Discogs's published
rate limit is 60 RPM authenticated; warm bursts at 4 concurrent × a few
refs each still leave headroom for the read path.
